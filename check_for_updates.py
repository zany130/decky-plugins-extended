"""Decide whether the published catalog is out of date.

Cloudflare rebuilds on push, so between pushes the catalog is frozen at whatever
upstream looked like at the last deploy. This compares what is live against the
current upstream catalog and the latest release of every configured repository.
It deliberately does not hash anything: names and version strings are enough to
know a rebuild is needed, and the rebuild does the expensive work.

The test is "is this version missing from the live entry", not "does the newest
version match". The catalogs merge GitHub releases into upstream entries, so ours
is often ahead of Deckbrew -- CheatDeck and PlayTime are both ahead today -- and
an equality check would report a change on every run forever.

Writes changed=true|false to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and stdout.
